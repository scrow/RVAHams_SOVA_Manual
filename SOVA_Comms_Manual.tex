\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Welcome}

Welcome to the Special Olympics Virginia Communications Team!

The SOVA Comms Team provides a unique package of services to Special Olympics Summer Games, combining our understanding of their needs with our equipment, technical knowledge, and professional standards to provide a \emph{total communications solution}.

Whether this is your first time participating as a communications volunteer for Special Olympics or you have joined us many times before, please take the time to review this manual each year.  It contains all the information you should need to better understand this event along with your roles and responsibilities.

\chapter{General Event Information}

\section{Nature of the Event}

The Special Olympics Summer Games is a two-day event located at the University of Richmond and four offsite locations around town.  Activities include track and field, weight lifting, swimming, softball, and bowling.  The event also features Healthy Athletes, which provides eye exams, dental exams, and general health checkups.

Athletes and volunteers begin to arrive on-site Thursday afternoon and most stay at University of Richmond until Sunday morning.  Athletic events take place Friday and Saturday, with opening ceremonies in the Robins Center Friday evening and a dance Saturday night.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Our Role in the Event}

Amateur Radio operators help our community through direction and professional communication between volunteer coordinators and Special Olympic management staff.  Communications volunteers and Amateur Radio operators are also responsible for assisting and directing spectators and athletes alike.

\chapter{Communications Roles}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Communications Director}

The Communications Director is responsible for coordinating the amateur radio team's participation in Special Olympics activities.  The Communications Director meets with key event officials throughout the year to plan for amateur radio involvement and is responsible for the recruitment of communications volunteers and acquisition of all necessary equipment in advance of each year's event.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Net Controls}

The primary responsibility of Net Control is to ensure the orderly flow of communications between all stations through the use of a directed net.  Net Control maintains a list of communications volunteers, their assigned locations, and current status.  Requests for event status, weather, other information, and supplies are routed through either of two Net Controls, depending on the type of traffic.

\subsection{Primary Net Control}

The Primary Net Control station is manned by two volunteers who handle all traffic except for requests for physical assets which are fulfilled by Logistics Net Control.

Primary Net Control marks all stations in and out of service, keeps a record of the status of events (on time, ahead of schedule, running behind), and keeps key event staff up to date on event status, weather, and other critical details at prescribed intervals.

\subsection{Logistics Net Control}

Logistics Net Control handles all requests for supplies.  Any request for water, ice, tables, chairs, missing awards, microphones, or any other physical piece of equipment would be sent to Logistics Net Control, who has radio contact with University of Richmond staff, Special Olympics security personnel, and the medical team via other radio systems.  Logistics Net Control takes the request, relays it over other channels, and optionally provides and update to the requesting party when the resource has been fulfilled.

\subsection{Backup Net Control}

Backup Net Control monitors the designated backup repeater frequency for any calls, allowing for a quick transition to the backup repeater should congestion, interference, or other downtime impede communications on the main repeater.

Backup Net Control also fulfills requests for information on coaches and athletes, making and receiving phone calls as necessary to locate or reunite lost participants.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Shadow Units}

Shadows are assigned to key event staff and will follow them from point to point, keeping within arm's reach at all times.  The role of the Shadow is to send and receive traffic to and from their assigned event staff member.  This traffic may consist of requests for information on event status, supplies, or location.  Shadows may also need to take and hold onto messages for their assigned staff member during meetings and other activities where immediate communication is not possible.

Shadows are highly mobile, almost constantly on the move, and will likely walk over several miles each day.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Stationary Units}

Stationary units are assigned to specific locations such as tennis, bocce, swimming, softball, volunteer check-in, delgation check-in, transportation, and the awards tent.  They are responsible for sending and receiving traffic to and from the volunteers at the assigned location.  This traffic may consist of requests for information on event timing or weather, logistics, and lost athletes. 

Stationary volunteers don't usually move around more than their local event area. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Floaters}

Floaters are "spare" communications volunteers who may rotate from one location to another, providing temporary relief during breaks and filling in for volunteers who cannot be at their assigned location.  At the conclusion of an assigned shift, all communications volunteers are welcome (and encouraged) to remain on-site as a floater.  Additional help is always needed and appreciated.

\chapter{Comms Volunteer Guidelines}

\iffalse %%COMMENT%%
....SOMEWHERE IN THIS CHAPTER...
 * Stop and listen before making a call!
 * Cross Band - allow repeater to drop
 * You are an event guide and a Professional Communicator, be visible
   and answer questions, help out, go above and beyond 
\fi %ENDCOMMENT%%

\section{Licensing and Equipment Requirements}

You do not need to be a licensed amateur to participate on the communications team!  However, if you will be operating a radio on amateur frequencies, you must have a license of the appropriate class.

Communications volunteers are required to furnish their own radio equipment and should arrive at the event with their radio already programmed per the communications plan, which will be provided to all volunteers in advance of the event.  Limited assistance with programming radios, verifying functionality, and resolving technical issues will be available the day of the event.  Additionally, a limited supply of loaner equipment will be available for use on a best-effort basis to assist in situations where existing equipment fails.

When programming a radio for this event, consider all amateur frequencies which will be in use, including on-site and off-site repeaters, simplex frequencies, and backup repeaters.  Take a moment to verify proper tone squelch and repeater offset values.

All volunteers are encouraged to come prepared with an additional battery pack, a headset, and a high-visibility safety vest to aid in visual identification.

We want to change emergencies.. No longer will we hold traffic for nets. We need 
to get back to the "Break Break" for emergency traffic, which then we hold only 
for the traffic, not until the ER is rectified. We need to work  HARD on getting 
Medical onto their own freq. and allowing logistics to handle the ER Dispatch, 
etc. We will be having a meeting in January with Leisha and Dave Polaski in 
regards. Wold like you to be there also. More to come here as we get closer, but 
Were taking control and selling the idea direct to Dave to get his buy in and 
push on Dennis. no more Dennis pushing us around. They need to do their job too!

 * Need to develop a FAQ - Net control runs event, Do Not Call 911,
   Don't know? Ask Net control, etc... Get food, and stay hydrated! 3rd
   party traffic is allowed - know when to hand the radio to that person!
