\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Welcome}

Welcome to the Special Olympics Virginia Communications Team!

The SOVA Comms Team provides a unique package of services to Special Olympics Summer Games, combining our understanding of their needs with our equipment, technical knowledge, and professional standards to provide a \emph{total communications solution}.

Whether this is your first time participating as a communications volunteer for Special Olympics or you have joined us many times before, please take the time to review this manual each year.  It contains all the information you should need to better understand this event along with your roles and responsibilities.

\chapter{General Event Information}

\section{Nature of the Event}

The Special Olympics Summer Games is a two-day event located at the University of Richmond and four offsite locations around town.  Activities include track and field, weight lifting, swimming, softball, and bowling.  The event also features Healthy Athletes, which provides eye exams, dental exams, and general health checkups.

Athletes and volunteers begin to arrive on-site Thursday afternoon and most stay at University of Richmond until Sunday morning.  Athletic events take place Friday and Saturday, with opening ceremonies in the Robins Center Friday evening and a dance Saturday night.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Our Role in the Event}

Amateur Radio operators help our community through direction and professional communication between volunteer coordinators and Special Olympic management staff.  Communications volunteers and Amateur Radio operators are also responsible for assisting and directing spectators and athletes alike.

\chapter{Communications Roles}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Communications Director}

The Communications Director is responsible for coordinating the amateur radio team's participation in Special Olympics activities.  The Communications Director meets with key event officials throughout the year to plan for amateur radio involvement and is responsible for the recruitment of communications volunteers and acquisition of all necessary equipment in advance of each year's event.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Net Controls}

The primary responsibility of Net Control is to ensure the orderly flow of communications between all stations through the use of a directed net.  Net Control maintains a list of communications volunteers, their assigned locations, and current status.  Requests for event status, weather, other information, and supplies are routed through either of two Net Controls, depending on the type of traffic.

\subsection{Primary Net Control}

The Primary Net Control station is manned by two volunteers who handle all traffic except for requests for physical assets which are fulfilled by Logistics Net Control.

Primary Net Control marks all stations in and out of service, keeps a record of the status of events (on time, ahead of schedule, running behind), and keeps key event staff up to date on event status, weather, and other critical details at prescribed intervals.

\subsection{Logistics Net Control}

Logistics Net Control handles all requests for supplies.  Any request for water, ice, tables, chairs, missing awards, microphones, or any other physical piece of equipment would be sent to Logistics Net Control, who has radio contact with University of Richmond staff, Special Olympics security personnel, and the medical team via other radio systems.  Logistics Net Control takes the request, relays it over other channels, and optionally provides and update to the requesting party when the resource has been fulfilled.

\subsection{Backup Net Control}

Backup Net Control monitors the designated backup repeater frequency for any calls, allowing for a quick transition to the backup repeater should congestion, interference, or other downtime impede communications on the main repeater.

Backup Net Control also fulfills requests for information on coaches and athletes, making and receiving phone calls as necessary to locate or reunite lost participants.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Shadow Units}

Shadows are assigned to key event staff and will follow them from point to point, keeping within arm's reach at all times.  The role of the Shadow is to send and receive traffic to and from their assigned event staff member.  This traffic may consist of requests for information on event status, supplies, or location.  Shadows may also need to take and hold onto messages for their assigned staff member during meetings and other activities where immediate communication is not possible.

Shadows are highly mobile, almost constantly on the move, and will likely walk over several miles each day.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Stationary Units}

Stationary units are assigned to specific locations such as tennis, bocce, swimming, softball, volunteer check-in, delgation check-in, transportation, and the awards tent.  They are responsible for sending and receiving traffic to and from the volunteers at the assigned location.  This traffic may consist of requests for information on event timing or weather, logistics, and lost athletes. 

Stationary volunteers don't usually move around more than their local event area. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Floaters}

Floaters are ``spare'' communications volunteers who may rotate from one location to another, providing temporary relief during breaks and filling in for volunteers who cannot be at their assigned location.  At the conclusion of an assigned shift, all communications volunteers are welcome (and encouraged) to remain on-site as a floater.  Additional help is always needed and appreciated.

\section{Licensing and Equipment Requirements}

Volunteers do not need to be a licensed amateur to participate on the communications team!  However, operating a radio on amateur frequencies will require a valid license of the appropriate class.

Communications volunteers are required to furnish their own radio equipment and should arrive at the event with their radio already programmed per the communications plan, which will be provided to all volunteers in advance of the event.  Limited assistance with programming radios, verifying functionality, and resolving technical issues will be available the day of the event.  Additionally, a limited supply of loaner equipment will be available for use on a best-effort basis to assist in situations where existing equipment fails.

When programming a radio for this event, consider all amateur frequencies which will be in use, including on-site and off-site repeaters, simplex frequencies, and backup repeaters.  Take a moment to verify proper tone squelch and repeater offset values.

All volunteers are encouraged to come prepared with an additional battery pack, a headset, and a high-visibility safety vest to aid in visual identification.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Volunteer Registration}

First and foremost, \textbf{walk-up volunteers are always welcome!}.  If you decide to join us the day of the event, please check in on-site at the Net Control office to be added to our volunteer roster.

To aid in planning, we need as many volunteers to pre-register for this event as possible.  Registration takes place through the RVAHams web site.  We will collect contact information including e-mail address and cell phone number and will use this information to communicate details about this event.  We will also collect radio equipment and assignment preferences (stationary vs. active position, indoors vs. outdoors, etc).

If plans change after registering and a communications volunteer can no longer work their assigned shift, or if they will be available to work additional hours, the coordinators should be notified as early as possible so we can incorporate these changes into the overall staffin plan.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Scheduling}

We will make every effort to accommodate your preference of location, time, and any special needs.  Pre-registering for this event will help us plan accordingly.  Please understand that from time to time we have last-minute needs to fill gaps in scheduling or add volunteers at additional locations, and we appreciate any flexibility you may have in adapting to last-minute changes in assignment and availability.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{What to Bring With You}

\textbf{Dress appropriately.}  Wear comfortable shoes and light colored clothing.  Bring proper sun protection.  Shadows should consider a lightweight backpack to store bottled water or a hydration pack along with a few small snacks.

\textbf{Radio and accessories.}  An extra battery pack (or two) is highly recommended, especially if scheduled more than a few hours.  This event generates a tremendous amount of radio traffic.  A headset is highly recommended;  a handheld speaker microphone is a good alternative to a headset.  All event locations are very noisy.  It will be extremely difficult to hear the speaker built into a radio.  A headset is \textbf{essential} for any volunteers stationed at swimming or bowling events.

\textbf{Medication, snacks, etc.}  Please remember to pack any prescription or over-the-counter medications.  It will be very difficult for us to fill scheduling gaps caused by volunteers who need to leave temporarily to retrieve forgotten items.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Volunteer Check-In}

All volunteers must check-in.  Communications volunteers at any of University of Richmond locations must check in in person.  Operators in the field can check in via net control when arriving on location.  During check-in, communications volunteers should receive a badge, hat, and any other information regarding the assigned post.  To allow adequate time for the check-in process, volunteers should arrive an hour prior to their assignment.  Once on post, communications volunteers should contact Net Control to confirm their position.  Check-in is located on the third floor on the South Concourse of the E. Claibourne Robins Stadium.  The Backup Net Control Operator will assist during the check-in process.

\section{Directed Net Basics}

All communications on amateur frequencies will take place in the form of a directed net.  A directed net means that all transmissions will take place with the coordination and direction of Net Control.  Here are a few guidelines when operating in a directed net:

\begin{itemize}

	\item To contact Net Control, stations should call ``Net Control'' followed by their tactical call sign and then \textbf{wait to be recognized}.
	\item If Net Control is busy handling other traffic, every effort will be made to immediately acknowledge calling stations but stations may still be asked to stand by before continuing with the contact.
	\item To contact another station, first make contact with Net Control.  When Net Control responds, stations should then ask to ``go direct'' with the other station.  Net Control may then grant permission for the communication to continue.
	\item \textbf{Before making any call, listen for a few moments to determine whether an existing conversation is in progress.}
	\item Stations feeding to interject information relating to an existing conversation may break in by simply giving their tactical call sign followed by the keyword ``information'' or ``reference'', and may proceed to give that information once acknowledged by either Net Control or any of the stations involved in the conversation.
	\item \textbf{If there is a medical emergency or any other emergency or priority traffic, announce the word ``break'' between transmissions and the net will immediately yield to the emergency traffic.}  The word ``break'' should \textbf{only} be used in emergency situations.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tactical Call Signs}

Tactical call signs can prevent confusion, saving a great amount of time and also aid in making a net run smoothly and efficiently.  Tactical call signs are used to identify a specific location or function.  They are especially helpful when multiple operators are being rotated (in shifts) or with the number of volunteers we are managing during this event.  When using tactical call signs, amateur operators only need to identify with their FCC-assigned call sign at the end of a transmission when they do not expect to transmit again within ten minutes and at the end of their shift assignment. (FCC Part 97.119) 

\rvahbox{Tactical Call Signs}{
Stations will primarily use tactical call signs during this event.  The use of tactical call signs does not relieve stations of their obligation to identify once every ten minutes or at the conclusion of a conversation, per FCC regulations.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Backup Plans}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Periodic Status Reports}

As amateur radio operators we are here to add value to the Virginia Special Olympic Summer Games.  We require our operators to call in to net control each hour with situation reports to include the status of the game the communications operator is assigned to: is the event ahead of schedule, on schedule or running behind and if so how far ahead or behind?  If an event is ending early, we need to know before and approximately at what time the event may end.  This information is vital to ensure we can coordinate transportation, adjust awards ceremonies, and maintain a controlled event.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Communicating with Net Control}

\subsection{Handling Resource Requests}

\subsection{Classifying and Routing Requests}

Radio traffic during any special event falls primarily into two main categories:

\itemize{
	\item \textbf{Informational.}  This type of traffic involves \textbf{non-tangible items} event status, weather, questions about event schedules, location of athletes and coaches, etc.
	\item \textbf{Logistics.}  This type of traffic involves \textbf{tangible items} such as water, ice, medals, microphones, tables, chairs, and other physical assets.  
}

All logistics traffic is directed to Logistics Net Control.  All other traffic goes to Primary Net Control.  Calls for informational traffic are best directed to ``Primary Net Control'' or simply ``Net Control''.  Logistics Net Control has contact with individuals capable of fulfilling requests for physical resources.

\rvahbox{Medical Calls}{All calls for medical emergencies and requests for the medical team will be handled by Logistics Net Control.}

\section{Leaving Assigned Post}

Communications volunteers SHOULD NOT leave their assigned posts until relieved by a relief operator or until re-assigned or relieved of duty by Net Control. This is vital to our operations to ensure we are able to cover operators who may either need a break, were unable to make the event due to last minute emergencies, etc.

We want to change emergencies.. No longer will we hold traffic for nets. We need 
to get back to the "Break Break" for emergency traffic, which then we hold only 
for the traffic, not until the ER is rectified. We need to work  HARD on getting 
Medical onto their own freq. and allowing logistics to handle the ER Dispatch, 
etc. We will be having a meeting in January with Leisha and Dave Polaski in 
regards. Wold like you to be there also. More to come here as we get closer, but 
Were taking control and selling the idea direct to Dave to get his buy in and
