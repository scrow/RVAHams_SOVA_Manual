\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Welcome}

Welcome to the Special Olympics Virginia Communications Team!

The SOVA Comms Team provides a unique package of services to Special Olympics Summer Games, combining our understanding of their needs with our equipment, technical knowledge, and professional standards to provide a \emph{total communications solution}.

Whether this is your first time participating as a communications volunteer for Special Olympics or you have joined us many times before, please take the time to review this manual each year.  It contains all the information you should need to better understand this event along with your roles and responsibilities.

\chapter{General Event Information}

\section{Nature of the Event}

The Special Olympics Summer Games is a two-day event located at the University of Richmond and four offsite locations around town.  Activities include track and field, weight lifting, swimming, softball, and bowling.  The event also features Healthy Athletes, which provides eye exams, dental exams, and general health checkups.

Athletes and volunteers begin to arrive on-site Thursday afternoon and most stay at University of Richmond until Sunday morning.  Athletic events take place Friday and Saturday, with opening ceremonies in the Robins Center Friday evening and a dance Saturday night.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Our Role in the Event}

Amateur Radio operators help our community through direction and professional communication between volunteer coordinators and Special Olympic management staff.  Communications volunteers and Amateur Radio operators are also responsible for assisting and directing spectators and athletes alike.

\chapter{Communications Roles}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Communications Director}

The Communications Director is responsible for coordinating the amateur radio team's participation in Special Olympics activities.  The Communications Director meets with key event officials throughout the year to plan for amateur radio involvement and is responsible for the recruitment of communications volunteers and acquisition of all necessary equipment in advance of each year's event.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Net Controls}

The primary responsibility of Net Control is to ensure the orderly flow of communications between all stations through the use of a directed net.  Net Control maintains a list of communications volunteers, their assigned locations, and current status.  Requests for event status, weather, other information, and supplies are routed through either of two Net Controls, depending on the type of traffic.

\subsection{Primary Net Control}

The Primary Net Control station is manned by two volunteers who handle all traffic except for requests for physical assets which are fulfilled by Logistics Net Control.

Primary Net Control marks all stations in and out of service, keeps a record of the status of events (on time, ahead of schedule, running behind), and keeps key event staff up to date on event status, weather, and other critical details at prescribed intervals.

\subsection{Logistics Net Control}

Logistics Net Control handles all requests for supplies.  Any request for water, ice, tables, chairs, missing awards, microphones, or any other physical piece of equipment would be sent to Logistics Net Control, who has radio contact with University of Richmond staff, Special Olympics security personnel, and the medical team via other radio systems.  Logistics Net Control takes the request, relays it over other channels, and optionally provides and update to the requesting party when the resource has been fulfilled.

We want to change emergencies.. No longer will we hold traffic for nets. We need 
to get back to the "Break Break" for emergency traffic, which then we hold only 
for the traffic, not until the ER is rectified. We need to work  HARD on getting 
Medical onto their own freq. and allowing logistics to handle the ER Dispatch, 
etc. We will be having a meeting in January with Leisha and Dave Polaski in 
regards. Wold like you to be there also. More to come here as we get closer, but 
Were taking control and selling the idea direct to Dave to get his buy in and 
push on Dennis. no more Dennis pushing us around. They need to do their job too!
