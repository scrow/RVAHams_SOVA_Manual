We want to change emergencies.. No longer will we hold traffic for nets. We need 
to get back to the "Break Break" for emergency traffic, which then we hold only 
for the traffic, not until the ER is rectified. We need to work  HARD on getting 
Medical onto their own freq. and allowing logistics to handle the ER Dispatch, 
etc. We will be having a meeting in January with Leisha and Dave Polaski in 
regards. Wold like you to be there also. More to come here as we get closer, but 
Were taking control and selling the idea direct to Dave to get his buy in and 
push on Dennis. no more Dennis pushing us around. They need to do their job too!
